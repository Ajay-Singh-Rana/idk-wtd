# idk-wtd
I don't know what to do is a repository which hosts some ill-formed projects of mine. These are projects that I started and work on when I just don't have any clue what I am doing with my life. Also, it hosts some notes and projects from stuff that I read at such times.

Below is the list of the projects with a minor description:

- **[pymaid](https://github.com/Ajay-Singh-Rana/idk-wtd/tree/main/pymaid)** : It is a project for creating graphs and charts. I took inspiration for this from the **mermaid** library though it's nothing when compared    to the library and is mostly ill-structured (shows my begginner ethics)
- **[pylox](https://github.com/Ajay-Singh-Rana/idk-wtd/tree/main/pylox)** : This one is an interesting repo. Here I'll try to implement the **Lox** language while am reading through the pages of **Crafting Interpreters By Robert Nystrom**
- **[notes](https://github.com/Ajay-Singh-Rana/idk-wtd/tree/main/notes)** : Just some notes on random topics that I have covered (not in detail, mostly insignificant to look at for others)
- **[kumaun-wiki](https://github.com/Ajay-Singh-Rana/idk-wtd/tree/main/kumaun-wiki)** : It is a website using __flask__ which is supposed to be an archive of my cultural heritage.
